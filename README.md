# Prodigy-Machine_Learning-Intership-Task
During my Prodigy-Infotech internship, I completed 5 tasks utilizing powerful Python libraries. I learned to handle data manipulation with Pandas, perform numerical operations with NumPy, create machine learning models with Keras.


# Task-01: Implement a Linear Regression Model to Predict House Prices
Objective:
Develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
